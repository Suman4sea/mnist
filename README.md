# 🔢 MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier

This project implements a neural network model using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It trains the model on image data and evaluates its performance on unseen test samples.

## 📁 Files

- `mnist.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full model pipeline and training steps.

## 🚀 Features

- Loads and preprocesses MNIST digit images 
- Normalizes pixel values for better training performance
- Builds a feedforward neural network with hidden layers and ReLU activation
- Uses softmax output for multi-class digit classification (0–9)
- Achieves high test accuracy on handwritten digit prediction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
